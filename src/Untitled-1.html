    Hello
    <br> Mate Robot Factory impressed by your success, they are ready to accept
    <br> you into the Tech team, you will learn to program robots together
    <br> with the team! Are you in business As a test task, you will need to
    <br> program our equipment that makes robots.
    <br>
    <br> Create a makeRobot function that takes the string name and the number
    <br> wheels, version and returns the robot object.
    <br> The robot coming off the assembly line must be able to:
    <br>  - Provide information about yourself through getter info.
    <br>    robot.info === 'name:%name%, chip version: %version%, wheels: %wheels%'
    <br>  - Provide the coordinates of your location via getter location.
    <br>    robot.location === '%name%: x=14, y=21'
    <br>  - Have methods to move goForward, goBack, goRight, goLeft.
    <br>  - Movement methods must be able to be used with a chain.
    <br>    robot.goForward().goForward().goForward().goLeft()
    <br>  - Default methods that move the work by 1 in the right direction.
    <br>    This value can be increased by passing the desired number to the method.
    <br>    Negative numbers should not affect the location of the robot. goLeft(3)
    <br>  - The coordinates of the robot must be stored in the object coords,
    <br>    the keys x and y inside the robot.
    <br>  - The robot must be able to request the evacuation of robot.evacuate(),
    <br>    which will call rescuers and transfer it to the service center
    <br>    at the coordinates x: 1400, y: 500.
